# ASPNET5
The BooksAngularApp is an SPA built on ASPNET 5 MVC 6 Web API using Angular JS at the front-end to manage and display the data. In the ASPNET project 
gulp has been used to manage the front-end JavaScripts code i.e. during the development while the changes are made, they are copied over
to the wwwroot folder. Also everytime the scripts files are copied, it cleans up the old files.
